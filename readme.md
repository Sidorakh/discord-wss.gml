# discord-wss.gml

A quick and dirty implementation of the Discord gateway/Client API in GameMkaer Studio 2.3 using Secure Websockets

Need to use beta IDE v23.1.1.457 or later to run this project (earliest version with secure websockets). Loads a Discord bot token from `datafiles/discord-token.txt`.
